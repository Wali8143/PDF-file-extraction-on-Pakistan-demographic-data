# Data Scraping Practice - Pakistan Demographic Data

This repository contains code for extracting tables from Pakistan demographic data using Python. The data source is https://www.pbs.gov.pk/census-2017-district-wise.

This is a personal practice project aimed at improving my data scraping skills. The code uses a combination of packages such as **pytesseract**, **pandas**, and **openCV** to scrape tables from the mentioned website and convert them into a usable format for analysis.

Feel free to use this code for your own projects or as a reference for similar data scraping tasks. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or make a pull request.
